    /*
        integer partitioning is a combinatorics problem in discreet maths
        the problem is to generate sum numbers which their summation is the input number

        e.g. 1 -> all partitions of integer 3 are:
        3
        2, 1
        1, 1, 1

        e.g. 2 -> for number 4 goes as:
        4
        3, 1
        2, 2
        2, 1, 1
        1, 1, 1, 1

        note: as you can see in examples, we want to generate distinct summations, which means 1, 2 and 2, 1 are no different
        you should generate all partitions of the input number and

        hint: you can measure the size and order of arrays by finding the pattern of partitions and their number
        trust me, that one's fun and easy :)

        if you're familiar with lists and arraylists, you can also edit method's body to use them instead of array
